# blog-math-anxiety
These are the blog entries on Learning about Math Anxiety hosted on anxiousatmath.blogspot.com

In this blog I will document my understanding about Math Anxiety as I learn about the topic. 

Points that I wish to cover (over several posts):
- What is Math Anxiety?
- Who is affacted by math anxiety?
- Do we know the causes of math anxiety (there may not be a definite answer to this)?
- What are some common triggers for math anxiety? What are some contributing factors?
- Why is being bad at math accepted socially?
- How do we overcome math anxiety? Can we get rid of our weakness in math?
- Where is math anxiety more/less common?
- Are social expectations shaping how we view our math expertise?
- Is there such a thing as a "Math Brain"?
- How do math experts deal with math anxiety? 
- Is math anxiety contagious? 

As the blog (hopefully) grows, so will this repo. The html files in this repo are meant to be drafts of the posts on the blog.

Hope you would enjoy reading about my journey as much as I enjoy writin about it!
