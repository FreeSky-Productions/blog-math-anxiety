<h2 style="text-align: left;">We don't need no <i>education</i>!</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 15pt">
<p> "Hey, Sakura! you have almost used up the whole class, may be just give up and let Mr. Kakashi teach." whispered Naruto from the front row.</p>
<p>Sakura was not yet ready to give up. She knew that her classmate Sasuke was wrong. She also believed that her teacher, Mr. Kakashi, was wrong as well. Mr. Kakashi was wrong to assign a homework problem on a topic that he did not teach, and now his mistake was in accepting the incorrect solution posted by Sasuke on the board.</p>
<p>"I still don't agree, Mr. Kakashi!" Sakura piped up for the fourth time today, "I have read the whole chapter on projectile motions a few times to try to understand how to solve this problem. You definitely cannot just apply the acceleration due to gravity to the initial velocity, you need to first split it into horizontal and vertical..."</p>
<p>Kakashi shook his head. "Seventh graders are dumb as rocks," he thought, "but this student is probably the densest of them all."</p>
<p>"I may not have a degree in Physics young lady, but I am sure too on how to apply Newton's laws." retorted Kakashi.</p>
<p>May be on any other day Sakura would have backed down, but today was different. She felt resolute in her mission. Even if it took the entire class period, she would keep on making her arguments. Little did she know, this conviction to learn independently and to challenge authority on their mistakes would lead little Ms. Sakura Haruno to win the Nobel Prize in Physics twenty years down the line.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Hey! Politicians! Leave our kids alone!</h2>

<p> In 2024, at the time of writing this post, the provincial government of Mantioba, Canada, has removed all subject requirements for certications to teach K-8 (kindergarten to grade eight). If you were not educated within Canadian systems, this may seem a bit confusing. Teaching at public schools in Canada requires a certification process designed and accredited by the respective provinces (and territories). This means that someone, even with decades of math teaching experience at the University and College level, will not automatically qualify to teach math at a Canadian public school until they meet further requirements for the certification. While that does create a job barrier, this system is supposed to ensure that the teachers at public schools know what to teach and how to teach the students at this level. Does the removal of subject requirements for the certification help fulfill this purpose?</p>

<p>There are a lot of nuances to this topic, many of which I am not even qualified to opine on. For example, just because the province does not require a teacher to have any math courses for the certificate to teach K-8, does that mean that schools will start hiring French teachers &mdash; with absolutely no background in higher level Mathematics &mdash; to teach math classes? Most likely (and hopefully) the answer is "no". After all, school administrators have a duty of due care and due diligence to the pupils. However, school budgets can be funny sometimes, and economic viability may tend to a future where this may eventually happen.</p>

<p>A follow up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Canada_sub/comments/1glqmqu/comment/lvytidb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">question</a>  then asks: "why do kindergarten teachers need to know Calculus?" This may not be a fair question, since the curriculum for K-8 covers upto, and including, grade eight. Having been taught Physics by a Physical Education teacher in grade seven, and Biology in grade eight by an Accounting teacher, I can attest to the difference it makes to have a non-specialist teach specialized subjects at these levels. Despite their best effort, these teachers are often missing foundational knowledge to properly respond to student questions about the subject. This may also exacerbate a dire situation where the teacher is not keen about the subject that they are teaching, regardless of their motivation towards teaching itself. Consequently the students may become ascerbated or exasperated with the experience and the subject.</p>

<p>Finally, when it comes to math, an assumption is often made that math specialists do not suffer as badly from math anxiety as non-specialists do. It is not far-fetched to assume that a non-specialist may be more intimidated about teaching math, although I have not yet come across research articles which have definitive tests for this hypothesis. My personal opinion on the matter is that the nature of math anxiety experienced may be different for math professionals compared to non-math majors. Anecdotally, I am familiar with quite a few high-achievers in Math that have expressed having specialized math anxiety, whereas non-math professionals often indicate a sense of a general anxiey towards math. <a href="http://">Tanuarto W.N.</a> mentions that "specific math anxiety is when a persion is anxious about a particular math situation, such as being fearful of fractions," whereas "global mathematical anxiety is when a person is stressed in all mathematical situations regardless of type of problem."</p>
  
  <p> Consequently, this post will make an assumption that a teacher who has never taken a university level mathematics course will have some math anxiety. Addtitionally, they may have some anxiety towards teaching a math class. Whether these are reasonable assumptions remain debateable, however, from <a href="http://">Ramirez et al.</a>, we know that "many elementary teachers have higher math anxiety than individuals in other fields of study, such as business, physical science, and health sciences".  Nevertheless, this post will try to shed light on how teacher math anxiety may affect student learning in math classes, with a slight bias towards the ansatz that teachers who have never taken math classes at the University level may experience higher levels of math anxiety than those who have.</p>


<h2 style="text-align: left;">All-in-all, you're NOT just another brick-in-the-wall!</h2>

<p>Without much experience teaching at the K-8 level, and also not being an active researcher on Math Anxiety, I request the reader to always consult the source materials and to take everything in these blog posts with a grain of salt. The topic of Math Anxiety is something I enjoy learning about, and these blog posts are simply companions to my journey. Also, I do have a bit of experience teaching mathematics, albeit not at the kindergarten level, so naturally there are some opinions that I hold on effective teaching and learning. The aim of this blog is to present selected points from academic papers on math anxiety, along with some personal commentary, usually contextualized around current events.</p>

<p>It is certainly concerning to note that the level of math anxiety is the highest amongst Elementary education majors compared to any other college majors, mentioned by both <a href="http://">Tanuarto</a> and <a href="">Ramirez et. al</a>. What would happen if one of these education majors was suddenly thrust in front of a classroom full of young inquisitive minds and asked to teach math? My son, who just started kindergarten this year, often asks deep questions about the math that he or his sister &mdash; in grade five &mdash; is learning. Yes, it is important to remember that even kindergarteners are not brought up in isolation; many-a-times they have an older sibling who they try to emulate. If his teacher were to have general math anxiety, then how would they have responded to my son's questions? Negative experiences with learning math at home or in class can lead to poor understanding and development of math skills (<a href="http://">Tanuarto</a>). As <a href="http://">Beilock and Willingham</a> puts it quite succinctly, "regardless of a student's gender, his or her teacher's math anxiety seems to carry implications for the student's level of math achievement."
</p>

<p>Research has shown that brighter minds often suffers the most disruption in math performance due to math anxiety (<a href="http://">Beilock et. al.</a>). Just to clarify, the former statement is not saying that the stronger students would have the highest level of math anxiety, rather that their math learning would suffer the worst from the mere presence of math anxiety. While this may be counterintuitive, <a href="http://">Beilock and Willingham</a> provides a very natural explanation: students with highest level of working memory often adopt advanced problem solving strategies that are cognitively demanding, and math anxiety simply disrupts these strategies. Once caught in the cycle of being anxious about math, students's performance in math may continue to go down due to a self-fulfilling aspect. In the words of <a href="http://">Tanuarto</a>:
  <blockquote>"...person who feels as if they are going to fail with math, which builds anxiety, which then leads to failure. Failure fosters the idea that they are not good at math which then creates even more math anxiety, creating more failure..."</blockquote>
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Catch!</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://">Ramirez et. al.</a> carried out a study in 2018 to investigate how teacher's math anxiety may affect student performance. The subject of their study was ninth grade mathematics, and they wanted to see whether teacher math anxiety had any affect on student math performance. Their paper is a fascinating read, and though there will be a few spoilers in this blog post, you may still wish to go and read the <a href="http://">source material</a> for unique insights into the matter. While it is a fantastic paper, the authors lean a bit too heavily on fixed versus growth mindset to my liking. This may be a product of the time the paper was published, when growth mindsets were all the rage. Some <a href="https://www.beautifulminds-newsletter.com/p/growth-mindset-theory-whats-the-actual">recent developments</a> into the theory of mindsets indicate the need for a closer look at this concept. Furthermore, as Max Lionel mentions so eloquently in episode one of his podcast titled <a href="https://heroicenglish.com/">Heroic English</a>, there may be other mindsets to consider when it comes to teaching and learning methodology.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, without referring to mindsets, let us look at the objective teaching deficiencies that arise from teachers having math anxiety. Combining ideas from <a href="http://">Tanuarto</a> and <a href="http://">Ramirez et. al.,</a> we can summarize that math teachers with math anxiety may
  <ul>
   <li>be less confident about successfully carrying out their teaching responsibilities,</li>
  <li>respond angrily to students request for help with mathematics, or spend less time attending to students' questions</li>
  <li>project their anxiety on students,</li>
  <li>have a tendency to accept responses quickly without checking solutions and correcting mistakes, which may create an environment that devalues sense-making,</li>
  <li>ask for a single solution to a problem, with emphasis on rote learning and algorithmic thinking.</li>  
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://">Ramirez et. al.</a> have shown that higher teacher math anxiety leads to lower student math performance, regardless of students' prior math achievements. Furthermore, students can quickly pick up on the teacher's attitude towards math, and this has a significant affect towards their math learning. This resonates with <a href="http://">Tanuarto</a>'s viewpoint that "math anxiety is taught in the classroom". Well then, what can be done to ensure that teachers feel confident in their preparation to teach math? <a href="http://">Beilock</a> provides a simple suggestion that has been proven effective in addressing math anxiety amoing pre-service teachers: get the teachers to take a course focused on how to teach math concepts. In fact, this strategy is better than requiring teachers take a course focused directly on math concepts themselves.
</p>

<p> Where does this leave us in our criticism of the Manitoban government's change in the requirements for K-8 teaching certificates? As with every idea, there are pros and cons. The obvious positive of this change is reflected by the purpose of the change: to make it easier to qualify for the certificate. Whether that will increase the quantity of available teachers is a question for time, but the more pertinent questions is what it may do to the quality of teachers that meet the new certification requirements? In particular, what will this do to the math teachers in the K-8 level? From a <emph>math anxiety</emph> point of view, this does make the math teachers more susceptible to math anxiety. This then creates a snowball effect which may eventually lead to generations of low math achievers from Manitoba. That is the fear. This is why such change must be inspected with a fine-toothed comb before we are ready to accept it.
</p>

<p>
An additional point that I want to put forward is related to the removal of the core-requirements of languages, sciences, and history and geography. In my experience, a well-rounded math teacher needs to have some understanding of these subjects as well. The relation between the sciences and mathematics is fairly obvious, as mathematics is the lingua-franca for modeling scientific phenomenon. History and geography benefit from many mathematical concepts as well (e.g., graphs, maps, trees, etc.). However, the subtle connection between languages and mathematics is what I find very interesting. Mathematics has it's own language which share many common traits with our common tongue, and the phenomenon of "Foreign Language Anxiety" has a lot of similarities with "Math Anxiety". This is a broader topic that I wish to investigate in the future, but for now, in my opinion, math teachers not taking language courses at the University level may be a bigger loss than anticipated.
</p>

<p>
Let's hope for the best!
