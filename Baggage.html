  Jolpona clenched her fists. Her face as white as the Canadian Winter, she
  slowly put her hand up. Mr. Andrews saw the timid hand go up and frowned. With
  a glaring stare and wrinkled eyebrows, he asked:
</p>
<p>"Do you need me to explain the problem again?"</p>
<p>" Umm, ..., no ..." came a soft reply.</p>
<div>
  "Well then, hey Jahangir, do you have the answer yet?" called out Mr Andrews.
</div>
<p>
  "<i>Wait, what?</i>" Jolpona screamed&nbsp;in her head! "<i
    >I was ready to answer that question, why did the teacher suddenly decide to
    skip me and go to Jahangir?</i

</p>
<p>
  It took her a lot of effort to raise her hand earlier, bringing it down felt
  so much simpler.

  Jahangir wasn't faring much better either. He had no idea how to solve this
  problem. The teacher had only gone over the idea once, and way too fast for
  Jahangir, who already struggles with Mr. Andrews' Welsh accent. However,
  Jahangir was not ready to be a martyr by asking Mr. Andrews to reiterate
  the&nbsp; problem. The last person to do so was summarily shot out of a canon,
  never to be seen again. So Jahangir just hung his face low, quietly begging
  the ground to split up and absorb him - so that he would not need to bear this
  ignominy in front of his peers.
</p>

<p>
  "Inconceivable" exploded Mr. Andrews, "None of you know how to solve this
  simple problem? You should have already known how to solve quadratic equations
  since grade school! I knew I should not have agreed to teach such a low-level
  math class. None of you are smart enough to do math, may be you should try
  something else."
</p>

<p>
  "You know what?" he continued roaring, "Just to make you all start taking my
  class seriously, we are going to have a pop-quiz right now on this question.
  Hmpf!"

  The next few blogposts will be focused on teachers. We started with things
  that can go wrong. Next we discuss what a teacher can do to reduce math
  anxiety for their students. Finally, we will end with personal accounts from
  accomplished mathematicians and instructors on how they dealt with their
  personal math anxiety, and how they help their own students overcome the fear
  of numbers.

    >Some Thoughts for Teachers on Mathematics Anxiety by Lorelei R. Brush</a
  >. Brush analyzed high school and college student responses in 1981 to the
  original ninety-four item Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (see footnote
  below) to conclude that while students may dislike the details in numeric
  computations, they are rarely anxious about them. On the other hand, many get
  anxious when they are forced to do something mathematical that other people
  with watch or evaluate.
</p>

<p>
  A key observation is that not only do math topics get more difficult from
  grade six through to grade twelve, but math anxiety also increases for
  students in general. In contrast, even with difficulty levels increasing,
  students feel less anxious about English (as a subject). Brush reasons that
  students perceive that they are limited to learning mathematics that has
  already been discovered, and the opportunities are few-to-none when it comes
  to contributing their own ideas to push the envelope of Mathematical
  knowledge. Once again, comparison is drawn to English studies, which in
  upper-levels often take the form of English literature, where the students
  have more opportunities to express their own ideas.

        <p>
          <strong>Humble-brag time: </strong>At the end of a first year algebra
          course, which introduced number theory, a student 'claimed' on the
          discussion board to have discovered the following theorem:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <emph
            >For any prime p, if you write down the prime twice, then the
            resulting number is composite.</emph
          >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          It is quite easy to see that this result is obviously true for any
          integer n ≥ 2 (not just primes). However, instead of providing a
          direct response, I let the students play with ideas for coming up with
          a proof, and prodded them to expand on their ideas in interesting
          directions. Very soon, the discussion left the realm of the original
          claim and started focusing on more abstract notions. By the end of the
          thread, the students were trying to come up with an algorithm to find
          all prime factors of numbers of the form `10^{2k} + 1`.
        </p>

        <p>
          The students' excitement in that thread was pulpable. They were keenly
          challenging each other, and commending each other's efforts. There
          were lots of 'Great Job!', 'I agree', and '... really interesting.'
          amongst the replies. It was polymath buzzing with positivity, and I
          genuinely believe that the experience elevated the students' enjoyment
          of Math.

<h2 style="text-align: left">quis docebit ipsos doctores</h2>

<p>
  Pardon my Latin, but I could not resist a poor man's rendition
  of&nbsp;Juvenal's question "quis custodiet ipsos custodes" - who guards he
  guardians? Brush, in 1981. came up with the following set of suggestions for
  math instructors. Teachers should:
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left">
  <li>choose explanations that maximize understanding.</li>
  <li>ease transition into new topics.</li>
  <li>invite lots of questions about the tough points in a lesson.</li>
  <li>give students perception that their ideas are new.</li>
  <li>include tasks that require creativity.</li>
  <li>
    design math examples to address issues that adults might deal with in every
    day life.
  </li>
  <li>create story plots around problems that capture human interest.</li>
  <li>
    let students work together towards gathering and analyzing information.
  </li>
  <li>
    change classroom practices (e.g., forcing students to solve problems on the
    blackboard in front of their peers) to reduce math anxiety.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These suggestions may seem trivial if you are a <i>good</i> teacher. A lot of
  these practices have been incorporated in modern teacher training. There are
  many great instructors who go above and beyond these suggestions and do an
  excellent job. Nevertheless, there are some teachers who may benefit from
  being reminded about these points. After all, the 1999 paper by Jackson and
  Leffingwell mentioned earlier show that only seven percent of their
  respondents had positive experiences with mathematics from kindergarten
  through college. It is our job as teachers to improve these numbers to include
  the other ninety-three percent. To do so, we must teach ourselves to do
  better.
