        <li>knowing that 15 - 8 = 7 ought to be as basic as knowing how to spell "cat".</li>
        <li> U.S. cultutre abounds with attitudes that forster math anxiety: Math is thought to be inherently difficult (as Barbie dolls used to say "Math class is hard"),
            aptitude is considered far more important than effort, and being good at math is considered relatively unimportant, or even optional.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Math anxiety</strong> is commonly defined as a feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with math performance.</li>
        <li> Hightly math anxious individuals avoid math. They take fewer elective math courses than people with low math anxiety. And when they take math,
            the receive lower grades.
        </li>
        <li>People with math anxiety tend to avoid college majors and career paths that depend heavily on math or quantitatie skills.</li>
        <li> math anxiety is only weekly related to overall intelligence.</li>
        <li>As <emph>conventional wisdom</emph> suggests, math anxiety is somewhat higher among women than men.</li>
        <li>The gender diefference is rather small, may be particularly apparaent in highly selected groups and may be partly attributable to a greater willingness on the part
            of women to disclose personal attitudes.
        </li>
        <li>when we recruited participants for research on math anxiety, we found fewer men than women at high anxiety levels, but just the revers at low levels.</li>
        <li>individuals who are high in math anxiety also tend to score high on other anxiety tests.</li>
        <li>Faust found psychological evidence of increasing reactivity (e.g., changes in heart rate) when a highly math-anxious group performed math tasks of increasing difficulty.
            When the same participants performed an increasingly difficult verbal task, there was hardly any increase in their reactivity and participants with low math anxiety showed
            virtually no increase in either task.
