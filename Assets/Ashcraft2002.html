    <h1>Direct Quotes from Ashcraft</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>knowing that 15 - 8 = 7 ought to be as basic as knowing how to spell "cat".</li>
        <li> U.S. cultutre abounds with attitudes that forster math anxiety: Math is thought to be inherently difficult (as Barbie dolls used to say "Math class is hard"),
            aptitude is considered far more important than effort, and being good at math is considered relatively unimportant, or even optional.
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Math anxiety</strong> is commonly defined as a feeling of tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with math performance.</li>
        <li> Hightly math anxious individuals avoid math. They take fewer elective math courses than people with low math anxiety. And when they take math,
            the receive lower grades.
        </li>
        <li>People with math anxiety tend to avoid college majors and career paths that depend heavily on math or quantitatie skills.</li>
        <li> math anxiety is only weekly related to overall intelligence.</li>
        <li>As <emph>conventional wisdom</emph> suggests, math anxiety is somewhat higher among women than men.</li>
        <li>The gender diefference is rather small, may be particularly apparaent in highly selected groups and may be partly attributable to a greater willingness on the part
            of women to disclose personal attitudes.
        </li>
        <li>when we recruited participants for research on math anxiety, we found fewer men than women at high anxiety levels, but just the revers at low levels.</li>
        <li>individuals who are high in math anxiety also tend to score high on other anxiety tests.</li>
        <li>Faust found psychological evidence of increasing reactivity (e.g., changes in heart rate) when a highly math-anxious group performed math tasks of increasing difficulty.
            When the same participants performed an increasingly difficult verbal task, there was hardly any increase in their reactivity and participants with low math anxiety showed
            virtually no increase in either task.
        </li>
        <li>highly math-anxious individuals end up with lower math competence and achievement.</li>
        <li>They are exposed to less math in school and apparently learn less of what they are exposed to; as a result, they show lower achievement as measured by standardized tests.</li>
        <li>If the relationship between anxiety and competence holds for all levels of math difficulty, then variations in competence will contaminate any attempt to examine
            math performance at different levels of math anxiety.
        </li>
        <li>One [way] is to test additional samples of participants on untimed pencil-and-paper versions of math problems studied in the lab.</li>
        <li>we found no anxiety effects on whole-number arithmetic problems with participants were tested using a pencil-and-paper format. But when participants were tested on-line (i.e.,
            when they were timed as they solved the problems mentally under time pressure in the lab), there were substantiak anxiety effects on the same problems.
        </li>
        <li>there were no math-anxiety effects whatsoever on the first-half of the test, which measured performance on whole-number arithmetic problems.</li>
        <li>Anxiety effects were apparent only on the second half of the test, which introduced mixed fractions, percentages, equations with unknowns, and factoring.</li>
        <li>individuals with high levels of math anxiety do not have a global deficit in math competence, and they can perform as well as their peers on whole-number arithmetic problems.</li>
        <li>When the anxiety was relieved, a truer picture of their competence emerged.</li>
