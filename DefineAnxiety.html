  <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>S</b></span>omething rare happened at work recently. I was running a Math drop-in session
  for an event called "Long Night Against Procrastination", and there were about
  six or eight students sat a table near me. Naturally, I went up to the group
  to introduce myself and welcome them to the drop-in. Turns out, this group was
  just waiting for pizza to be served, and their college program had no math
  courses. However, they mentioned that they were all fascinated by math, and
  asked me give them a math problem to solve while they waited for the pizza.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Intrigued, I inquired about their level of proficiency in math.
  They mentioned that they studied mathematics at the <i>intermediate level</i>.
  Astute readers may have noted my use of the definite article here - since this
  verbiage alludes to a particular education system - so please comment below if
  you are familiar with what "intermediate level" means. Anyways, back to the
  story. I asked them to solve the following relatively challenging calculus
  problem:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">`\int ( \sin x + \cos x )^{2} dx`.</div>

<p>
  It took some good old-fashioned team-work, perseverance, and a little guidance
  from yours truly, but the problem was solved within 30 minutes. Pizza still
  wasn't here. To my astonishment, this group of students loved working on the
  problem so much that they asked me for a second problem!
</p>

<p>
  This time they requested a Statistics problem as they felt more comfortable
  with that. In the fashion of a true Bond villain, I gave them a classic
  problem involving conditional probability:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    <i>Suppose in an epidemic, it is known that about 5% of the population is
      sick. Scientists have developed a rapid test which gives 3% false positive
      and 2% false negative results. Given an individual has tested negative,
      what is the probability that they are sick?</i>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Of course the students were stumped. This was not an easy problem.
  Nevertheless, they were keen to understand how to work through the problem.
  Once I explained the idea of tree-diagrams in conditional probability, they
  were soon able calculate marginal probabilities. After a brief demonstration
  of Bayes' rule using the tree-diagram (I never wrote down the formula for
  Bayes' rule for these students), they were able to get the solution. Their excitement was pulpable. Alas, pizza
  arrived soon after, so math took the backseat. Nevertheless, they stayed back
  to shake my hands after finishing their meal.
</p>

<p>
  What I saw in those students that day was love and joy from discovering
  mathematics. Remember, these students have not taken, and will not be taking,
  any college math courses. It was unusual that they would want to solve math problems, and downright improbable that they would enjoy the process. This experience brought me an exuberance that I
  haven't felt in quite some time. Wouldn't it be lovely if all of my engagements were so positive?</p>
