      <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>S</b></span>omething rare happened at work recently. I was running a Math drop-in session
      for an event called "Long Night Against Procrastination", and there were about
      six or eight students sat a table near me. Naturally, I went up to the group
      to introduce myself and welcome them to the drop-in. Turns out, this group was
      just waiting for pizza to be served, and their college program had no math
      courses. However, they mentioned that they were all fascinated by math, and
      asked me give them a math problem to solve while they waited for the pizza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Intrigued, I inquired about their level of proficiency in math.
      They mentioned that they studied mathematics at the <i>intermediate level</i>.
      Astute readers may have noted my use of the definite article here - since this
      verbiage alludes to a particular education system - so please comment below if
      you are familiar with what "intermediate level" means. Anyways, back to the
      story. I asked them to solve the following relatively challenging calculus
      problem:
    </p>
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">`\int ( \sin x + \cos x )^{2} dx`.</div>
    
    <p>
      It took some good old-fashioned team-work, perseverance, and a little guidance
      from yours truly, but the problem was solved within 30 minutes. Pizza still
      wasn't here. To my astonishment, this group of students loved working on the
      problem so much that they asked me for a second problem!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This time they requested a Statistics problem as they felt more comfortable
      with that. In the fashion of a true Bond villain, I gave them a classic
      problem involving conditional probability:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Suppose in an epidemic, it is known that about 5% of the population is
          sick. Scientists have developed a rapid test which gives 3% false positive
          and 2% false negative results. Given an individual has tested negative,
          what is the probability that they are sick?</i>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        Of course the students were stumped. This was not an easy problem.
        Nevertheless, they were keen to understand how to work through the problem.
        Once I explained the idea of tree-diagrams in conditional probability, they
        were soon able calculate marginal probabilities. After a brief demonstration
        of Bayes' rule using the tree-diagram (I never wrote down the formula for
        Bayes' rule for these students), they were able to get the solution. Their excitement was pulpable. Alas, pizza
        arrived soon after, so math took the backseat. Nevertheless, they stayed back
        to shake my hands after finishing their meal.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What I saw in those students that day was love and joy from discovering
        mathematics. Remember, these students have not taken, and will not be taking,
        any college math courses. It was unusual that they would want to solve math problems, and downright improbable that they would enjoy the process. This experience brought me an exuberance that I
        haven't felt in quite some time. Wouldn't it be lovely if all of my engagements were so positive?</p>

          <h2>Where's the beef? - Defining Math Anxiety.</h2>
          
          How did the above math problems make you feel? Did you find yourself in one of
          the groups below?
          <ol>
            <li>
              You felt an urge to solve the problems right-away. May be you are able to
              solve these problems in your head, or at least immediately know how to
              arrive at the solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              You recognized the problems. They seem familiar, and with some effort, you
              know how to solve them. Something that you may do later when you have more
              time at hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              You briefly glanced at the problems and moved on without sparing a
              thought. Those math problems are only accessories to the story, so why pay
              any attention, right?
            </li>
            <li>
              You cringed, or perhaps even cowered, looking at those problems. Math
              isn't really your thing. How can someone even enjoy math like that?
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>
            These are all valid reactions, but the last two groups may be exhibiting
            signs of math anxiety. The purpose of this blog is to learn about math
            anxiety, so you have come to the right place. In this post, let us define
            math anxiety. Our primary sources will be papers from 1972 (<a

            Here are some of my key takes on the definition of math anxiety from the
            papers. Some of these points are direct quotes, and others are portmanteaux
            of quotes combined from the papers. In other words, the points below are not
            my own words or thoughts, a declaration I feel compelled to make as an
            honest academic.

                <i> Richardson and Suinn states
                  <strong>Mathematics anxiety</strong> involves feelings of tension
                  and anxiety that interfere with the manipulation of numbers and the
                  solving of mathematical problems in a wide variety of ordinary life
                  and academic situations.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Ashcraft refines the definition to say
                    <strong>Math anxiety</strong> is commonly defined as a feeling of
                    tension, apprehension, or fear that interferes with math
                    performance.</i>

                    <i>
                      Highly math anxious individuals avoid math. They take fewer elective
                      math courses than people with low math anxiety. And when they take
                      math, they receive lower grades. Thus, mathematics anxiety may
                      prevent a student from passing fundamental mathematics courses or
                      prevent his pursuing advanced courses in mathematics or the
                      sciences.</i>

                        money, balancing bank accounts, evaluating sales prices, or dividing
                        work loads.

                        U.S. culture abounds with attitudes that foster math anxiety: Math
                        is thought to be inherently difficult (as Barbie dolls used to say
                        "Math class is hard"), aptitude is considered far more important
                        than effort, and being good at math is considered relatively
                        unimportant, or even optional.

                <p>
                  First, let's note that the current definition of math anxiety really tracks
                  back to 1972. Although Ashcraft refines the definition somewhat in 2002,
                  it's still fundamentally the same. I checked a couple of recent papers from
                  2021 (<a
                  href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fbul0000307"

                  >Barroso et. al.</a

                  target="_blank"
                  >Gonzalez-DeHass et. al.</a
                  >) to see if there is an updated definition, but found out that they both
                  refer back to one of these two definitions. May be the age-old principle of
                  "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies here. However, in my opinion, with
                  the advancement in our understanding of cognitive and physical manifestation
                  of anxiety in the past 50 years, there should be a more recent attempt at
                  defining math anxiety. If any of you know of any other accepted definition
                  of math anxiety, please comment below.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Next, it is quite clear from the discussions of both sets of authors that
                  math anxiety is an independent concept. Certainly it's quite interesting
                  that math-anxious individuals may otherwise not be affected by other types
                  of anxiety, although there is mention of high degree of association between
                  math- and test-anxiety. As I have always strongly suspected, intelligence is
                  not a factor. So no more "<i>you must be smart because you study math</i>"
                  please. Perhaps this also explains the epigraph for this post. For bonus
                  points, can you name the famous scientist who is being quoted, and finish
                  the full quote in the comments?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Math-anxiety seems to have an effect at all levels of study. In particular,
                  this phenomena is quite common amongst college population. Ashcraft notes
                  that at high level mathematics it becomes more difficult to separate math
                  anxiety from math incompetence. To get a true picture of math competence for
                  an individual, it becomes important to relieve the anxiety attached to math.
                  Could this be achieved through meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, Or
                  through medication? In their respective papers, Richardson and Suinn goes
                  further into measuring the level of math-anxiety, while Ashcraft discusses
                  personal, educational, and cognitive consequences of math anxiety. I plan to
                  cover both of these topics in a later post.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Finally, I am personally drawn towards the comment about U.S culture by
                  Ashcraft. I was not educated in North America until I started my
                  undergraduate degree in Physics at a Canadian university. For a long time I
                  was always surrounded by people who love math, and use very high level math
                  in their work. So it was indeed a culture shock when I first encountered a
                  negative attitude towards math. How could someone not love math? Well, turns
                  out that a lot of people don't like it, and are often afraid of it. Is this
                  a cultural phenomenon? May be so. Remember the story from the start of this
                  post? I deliberately did not mention anything about where the students were
                  from, but left a strong hint by indicating the way they referred to their
                  education level. I want to know your perspectives on math. Were you part of
                  a math-culture while growing up? How did the people around you think about
                  math problems? Did that influence you? Let me know in the comments.
