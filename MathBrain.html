  <h1>Born with a Math Brain</h1>

    <p>Sylvanna: Nice to meet you. What is your role at the college?</p>
    <p>Me: I am a Math Consultant. I help students with math. </p>
    <p>Sylvanna: Wow! I am so glad you are here. If students ever asked me a math question, I wouldn't know what to do; may be I would cry! I am so terrible at math</p>
    <p>Me: ... No at all. I am sure you use math everyday in some capacity! You are probably quite good at it too. It's not like I was born with a math brain and you weren't ... </p>

    Cab drivers, librarians, even college biology professors have expressed to me that they just don't know what to do if someone asks them a math question. They don't mean math questions that involves complicated formula or abstract topics, but questions that they surely know how to answer. They feel worried, anxious - as if some one put them on a stage unprepared and shone a spotlight on them - when asked about math. They are just happy that there are "math" people to help tackle these problems. This may all sound fine and familiar so far, not everyone needs to an expert in math just like how not everyone needs to be Picasso. However, everyone does need to be able to calculate result from simple arithmetic operations just as a life skill. But many say that they <emph>can't</emph>, and the problem begins whensociety starts to accept this math ineptitude and individuals wear it as a badge of honour.
