  <h1>Born with a Math Brain</h1>

    <p>Sylvanna: Nice to meet you. What is your role at the college?</p>
    <p>Me: I am a Math Consultant. I help students with math. </p>
    <p>Sylvanna: Wow! I am so glad you are here. If students ever asked me a math question, I wouldn't know what to do; may be I would cry! I am so terrible at math...</p>
    <p>Me: ... No at all. I am sure you use math everyday in some capacity! For example, when you are driving to Toronto from Waterloo, you are probably doing all sorts of complicated math in your head to see if you will reach there in time. However, you mentioned that when someone asks you a "math" question, you get worried. There is a concept that fit well with what you described. It's called math anxiety, and I have just started learning about it ... </p>

    <emph>Sylvanna</emph> is not a real person, but the conversation above is very real. I have had very similar conversations with people from all facets of life. Cab drivers, librarians, even college biology professors have expressed to me that they just don't know what to do if someone asks them a math question. They feel worried, anxious - as if someone shone a spotlight on them while they are on stage, unprepared. They are just happy that the "math" people are available to help tackle these problems. Perhaps this is fine and fair; not everyone needs to an expert in math just like how not everyone needs to be Picasso. However, each of us often handle fairly complicated arithmetic in our everyday life - the cab driver finds the shortest route to their next fare, the librarian knows how many copies of a book to order based on the popularity of the book, the biology professor has a fair idea on how the H-index of their recent publication is growing - so why do we get stuck frozen in approaching headlights if we have to suddenly do the same math as a "math problem"? Why do many say, with some pride, that they simply aren't a "math person"? Perhaps the problem really begins to take root when the society around us starts to accept this inability to do math as the norm, and individuals start wearing it as a badge of honour.

  I have studied mathematics for quite some time, and have been good at it most of the time. With a graduate degree in mathematics, an enviable average score in university math courses, and a distinction for achieving the world's highest math score in O-level mathematics, I am fairly confident in my math abilities. I have chosen mathematics teaching and consulting as a profession.  However, that does not mean that I have a math brain. Conversely, I don't have any natural talent when it comes to numbers or counting. For untalented people like us, learning mathematics needs dedication and striving. I learned math because I liked math, and I enjoyed learning math. When preparing for my O-level math exam - where I stamped my first real success at being good at math - my first "mock" test received a score of 58%, the lowest amongst my peers. That was a good time to give up, to walk away saying that I am not a math person, that I was not born with a math brain. Nevertheless, I had a desire to learn from my mistakes. I accepted that I was unprepared for the test, and I decided to make changes. Those changes led me to where I am today. The same changes that I now try to instill into the struggling students that I meet at work.

    Last week, a student started his session saying "I am really terrible at Math". However, at the end of the session, our (both the student's and mine) realization was that he was not bad at math at all. He was able to walk through all the difficult algebra and complicated rules of logarithms required to solve his problem. His struggle was with making connections between the steps. Simply trying to think about which rule to use to start solving the problem froze him in fear. A fear that is very real. An anxiety that led him to conclude that he is "terrible at math".

    I have always been interested in the science of learning. In highschool I studied memory curves, learning techniques, and good study habits that I follow to this day. As a math instructor, I learned about effective math teaching and learning techniques - enhancing the learning experience with fun math puzzles, revisiting concepts in new context and challenging the students to rediscover them, and connecting the theoretical math knowledge from the course to applications in industry and research. Now, as a math consultant, I have to often convince students that they are not "terrible at math", and that there isn't such a thing as a math brain. This has led me to investigate math anxiety.
  </p>
  
  <p>Currently, I know very little about math anxiety. That is exactly why I decided to share my journey into studying math anxiety with everyone. Let us venture together, in no particular order, towards finding the answers to some burning questions that I have.
  <ul>
    <li>What is Math Anxiety?</li>
    <li>Who is affected by math anxiety?</li>
    <li>Do we know the causes of math anxiety (there may not be a definite answer to this)?</li>
    <li>What are some common triggers for math anxiety? What are some contributing factors?</li>
    <li>How do we overcome math anxiety? Can we get rid of our weakness(es) in math?</li>
    <li>Why is being bad at math often accepted socially? Are social expectations shaping how we view our math expertise?</li>
    <li>When and where is math anxiety more/less common? Is there a specific education level that sees a spike in math anxiety? Are there some cultures/countries that are nearly immune to it?</li>
    <li>Is there really such a thing as a "Math Brain"?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

    At the moment, I don't have the answers to many of these questions. My plan is to read academic books and articles on the topic and share my understanding with you through this blog. There will be some personal opinions and commentaries, but I will try to maintain an objective approach. Hopefully you will find this to be an honest, unbiased, and educational endeavour (or endeavor if your prefer the US spelling). Answering the above questions is just a beginning. At the moment, I don't have an end goal.

Feel free to provide expert opinions or contribute to the blog with your own post. There may be some subject matter experts in the audience - please let us know about good resources to learn about math anxiety or correct us if we misunderstand something. Just like projects in polymath, let us all contribute, and make this blog a great resource for everyone to learn about math anxiety.</p>
